Hello, fellow cat lovers! I'm Vanessa, a cat sitter (and web developer) based in Pontinha.

Ever since I can remember, my heart has been captivated by the grace and charm of our feline companions.
I always wanted to become a cat mom and today I find myself fortunate enough to share my home with a spirited ball of orange fur named Poki.
This mischievous five-year-old bundle of joy brings endless laughter to my life with his playful antics and insatiable curiosity.

As a web developer by trade, I've channeled my passion for cats into creating a space where cat parents can get to know me and entrust their beloved fur babies with peace of mind.
Whether you're jetting off on a well-deserved vacation or simply need a helping hand in your busy schedule, rest assured that your furry family members will be in loving and capable hands.

I'm happy to provide personalized care, tailored to the unique needs and preferences of each individual cat.
From gentle chin scratches to stimulating play sessions, I strive to always create a nurturing and enriching environment.
So whether your whiskered companion prefers lounging in the sunbeams or embarking on grand adventures, let me be your trusted partner in ensuring their happiness and well-being.
Because when it comes to cats, there's no such thing as too much love or too many cuddles!

Thank you for considering my services. I can't wait to meet you and your furry friends!

Paws and whiskers,\
Vanessa
