## When do we meet?

The first step is to schedule an introductory visit to your home - free of charge - to get to know your cat, the family, the living space and the routines.

There is no commitment associated with this visit and it can be scheduled via email (vanessathecatlady@gmail.com) or mobile (+351 911183985).


## Are there rules around scheduling a visit?

Appointments can be made at any time. It is possible to change scheduled dates, subject to availability.

Visits take place between 8:00 AM and 10:00 PM, seven days a week. The exact timing depends on my schedule for the day.


## Where do you provide cat sitting services?

I do home visits to cats living in the Lisbon and Odivelas region. If you really need help and you're outside of these regions, please reach out. I may be available and we may work things out.


## I need a personalized service. Are you flexible?

If your cat has unique needs or preferences, I’m happy to customize my services to ensure your pet feels comfortable and happy.


## How much do you charge for your services and how do I pay?

The standard service has a cost of €10 per visit. Payments should be made at the end of the visits and can be made by bank transfer, via Mbway, or in cash.


## Do you offer any discounts?

Discounts may be offered depending on the number of visits scheduled.


## Are you able to take care of cats that need to take medication?

I'm comfortable with administering medication to cats. However, this also depends on your cat’s cooperation. Administering medication has an extra cost of €1 per service. Scheduling visits at specific times for medication administration is subject to confirmation.


## What if there's a medical emergency?

In the event of a medical emergency, I will attempt to contact the tutor to obtain approval for the necessary intervention. If I am unable to reach the tutor, I will take the best possible actions to ensure the cat's safety and well-being.

The client is responsible for all resulting expenses, including transportation to the veterinary clinic or hospital.


## Is deworming required?

Regular contact with multiple cats raises the risk of spreading external parasites. Therefore, I strongly recommend that all pets be properly dewormed before the visits begin.


## I didn't leave enough food for my cat. What now?

Tutors must provide all the necessary items for the well-being of the cats during their absence. Exceptionally, I can purchase any missing items such as litter or food. In addition to the cost of the purchased products, an additional fee of €5 will be charged for this extra service.


## What if anything gets broken in the household?

I do not take responsability for damages caused by the cat or for damages resulting from the use of poorly maintained resources.


## Feedback

I am always striving to improve. Therefore, clients are encouraged to openly communicate any dissatisfaction so that I can clarify and address any issues that did not meet expectations.
