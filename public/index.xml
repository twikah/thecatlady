      <description>Hello, fellow cat lovers! I&amp;rsquo;m Vanessa, a cat sitter (and web developer) based in Pontinha.&#xA;Ever since I can remember, my heart has been captivated by the grace and charm of our feline companions. I always wanted to become a cat mom and today I find myself fortunate enough to share my home with a spirited ball of orange fur named Poki. This mischievous five-year-old bundle of joy brings endless laughter to my life with his playful antics and insatiable curiosity.</description>
